# Vector-Template
This repository contains code for a template vector class. This is my own implementation of the vector in STL. 
I created this to help understand the backend of vector ADTs and iterators.

*********************************************************************************************************************

There are 3 files along with a Makefile in this repository:
tvector.h includes the declaration for two template classes (TVector and TVectorIterator)
tvector.hpp includes the definitions for the two template classes
driver.cpp includes a calling to all functions in the TVector classes and was used to check my work

*********************************************************************************************************************

As I learn more about data structures and algorithms, I plan to first take a look at how each ADT works.
Writing this code helped me understand how to use the Vector ADT much better and was an introduction to iterators.
Iterators are used to help navigate through many different container classes.
Iterators may not be needed in the Vector ADT since it is based on arrays, however impleminting iterators is a good practice.
